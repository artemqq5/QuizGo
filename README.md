### Quiz Go App

The "Quiz Go" app is an interactive quiz for Android devices, developed using modern technologies and programming practices. It is created in the Kotlin programming language, which is popular for Android apps due to its cleanliness and efficiency. "Quiz Go" is supported on most modern Android devices, from Android 7.0 to 14.0.

The app uses a special technology (ViewBinding) that allows developers to easily manage the interface, making user interaction more intuitive and convenient. Additionally, "Quiz Go" incorporates advanced methods for code organization, including Hilt for dependency management, which helps keep the code clean and easy to understand.

The app's appearance is stylish and modern, thanks to the use of the latest design libraries such as Material Design. "Quiz Go" promises to be not only useful but also visually appealing for quiz enthusiasts.

### Details

1. **Hilt (Dependency Injection Framework)**:
   - Hilt is a framework for dependency injection in Android. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies in the app, automatically providing components like classes, services, and repositories with necessary resources. This reduces the coupling between components, promotes modularity, and improves testing.

2. **Navigation Component (Navigation Management)**:
   - The Navigation Component from Android Jetpack simplifies the implementation of navigation between different screens and fragments in the app. It provides a visual way to manage the navigation flow, allowing developers to more easily visualize and manage transitions between screens.

3. **View Binding (UI Elements Binding)**:
   - View Binding is a component of Android Jetpack that provides a safe and simple way to interact with UI elements. It allows developers to directly refer to interface elements in code without the risk of runtime errors, contributing to the stability and reliability of the app.

4. **Parcelize (Data Transfer Optimization)**:
   - Parcelize is a Kotlin feature that simplifies the process of serializing and deserializing objects for data transfer between app components. It is used for efficient transmission of complex data, such as objects, between screens or fragments, ensuring ease and reliability of this process.

5. **Clean Architecture (App Structuring)**:
   - Clean Architecture is an approach to structuring code that separates the business logic of the app from the user interface and data. This approach allows for the creation of an app where changes in one part minimally affect others, facilitating maintenance, scalability, and testing.
